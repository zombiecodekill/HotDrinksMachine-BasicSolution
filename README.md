# HotDrinksMachine-BasicSolution
Work in progress solution for the HotDrinksMachine-Kata

For details on the Kata see https://github.com/zombiecodekill/HotDrinksMachine-Kata

I have kept it to just the three drinks Lemon Tea, Coffee and Hot Chocolate for now but adding buttons to refill stocks. 

Not yet using a UI framework yet mainly because there isn't much of a UI and not much DOM manipulation in the application.

There is a suite of Jasmine specs that can be run using the SpecRunner.html file. 
To run the specs the latest version of Jasmine and put the jasmine directory inside the HotDrinksMachine directory.
